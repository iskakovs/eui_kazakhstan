# Economic Policy Unicertainty Index for Kazakhstan
This project utilizes Python to analyze daily and weekly news articles published in Kazakhstan to construct an Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index for the country. Following the methodology of Baker et al. (2016), the project quantifies economic policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of specific keywords in the news. This index aims to provide insights into the levels of economic uncertainty over time in Kazakhstan.
